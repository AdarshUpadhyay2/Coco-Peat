      "Coco substrates are soil enhancers which are mixed with peat moss to enhance soil characteristics such as drainage, aeration and water holding capacity to promote better root growth in horticultural applications. Coco substrates are collected as by-product out of coir fiber extraction from dried coconut husks. Hence it is an environment friendly 100% natural growing medium from renewable coconut plantation with no deforestation. Kokosflora coco substrates are triple washed to remove excessive water soluble salts and other impurities to bring the electrolyte contents within the range.",
    benefits: [
      "Coco substrate increases the porosity of the soil mix and promotes air circulation and keeps the soil loose. This leads to better root growth and higher yield.",
      "Coco substrate with increases water retention capacity of the soil mix and releases water slowly to the roots.",
      "Coco substrate increases water drainage properties of the soil mix and prevents overwatering.",
      "Coco substrate is a good choice for soil less cultivation; as an organic medium with high cation exchange, nutrients are easily absorbed by the plant roots.",
      "Coco substrate naturally contains Trichoderma Harzianum that acts against harmful pathogens that affect the roots.",

    additionalInfo:
      "Kokosflora also offers Coco germination pots that are made up of natural coconut fibers in different sizes and shapes that are 100% bio-degradable. Coco germination pots in combination with Coco disk / tab make an excellent choice for plant propagation. Coco disk/tab placed inside the coco pot, upon adding water, expands to fill pot and becomes growing media for the seed. Later young sapling in the coco germination pot can be directly planted into the soil/earth, thereby preventing transplant shocks and root damages- and the coco germination pot will slowly biodegrade into the soil and become manure for the plant. This helps saving the environment by avoiding plastic tray pileup in nurseries.",
